Download the mongodb from the site https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=homepage#community for appropriate operating system
Then extract the package and install it without mongodbcompass which takes much time 
The files will be installed at C:\programfiles folder
Come to C:\ and create directory data 
Inside the data folder create db which will be used by the mongodb
Now run the mongod.exe in bin folder of Mongodb in programm files
After the successful execution run the Mongo.exe in a new terminal which gives you access to create and update the nosql databases
Tutorials for the integration of mongo with python and exclusive mongodb are found in Mongo_python, Mongo_tutorials folders respectively
